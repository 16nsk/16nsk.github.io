If you want to learn more about WordPress on MicroK8s, check my
[book](https://leanpub.com/wp-microk8s) where I
detail everything possible to run WordPress on Kubernetes using MicroK8s,
adding Elastic Search for blazing speed, setting up horizontal scaling
WooCommerce shops to handle Black Friday events, setting up cache the right
way, getting real monitoring and observability of WordPress and all the
infrastructure empowering it.

Subscribe and let me know how much you would pay for such a book, it will
help me before publishing it, soon in early, even unfinished stage.
