<p>My name is Madalin-Gabriel Ignisca.</p>
<p>I have a passion for technology and web development.</p>

<p>
  With more then 10 years of experience creating and maintaining complete online solutions with web technologies,
  including Docker, PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, Angular, database driven web applications,
  I am being able to deliver small to medium sized projects in small teams or alone.
</p>

<p>
  Among that, I can build and maintain custom complex CI/CD solutions, on top of the popular public cloud providers
  and also using bare metal, private cloud, Linux based implementations. I can take existing projects and help them
  integrate in an automated process of build, test and deployment, that can solve current facing problems of
  legacy development and delivery processes.
</p>

<p>
  If you have the idea and finances for the next cool thing, I can bring the technical brain for it, including additional
  people required for.
