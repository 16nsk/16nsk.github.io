Lately I've been thinking more and more in going back working remote only as a developer / devops engineer.

Since I became a dad, I started to feel in office work much more stressful for personal life, which now involves
a larger family. I started to feel that time spent with my children is the most critical, and without the
flexibility to have more time for them, office work became something that feels painful, then giving any
sense of good achievements.

I do work for a company that offers great things for all the employes, but still, more I analyze things,
make me realize how much I personaly loose for having to work a 9am to 5pm adding time spent commuting.

That's why I'm really looking forward in switching back either to work fully remote or either be open for an
opportunity that would be really close to where as a family decided it's in our best to live.
